### Simmtronic Office Building Design and Update
**(2024)**
Daily use of Autodesk AutoCAD to create accurate floor and ceiling plans of the client's office and warehouse
Daily use of Autodesk Revit to build 3D building models and creating specific component families for clients

Direct interaction with clients to understand their individual needs: gathered continual feedback and accurately incorporated suggestions into the model
Built a digital twin of the client's building, complete with lighting and mechanical fixtures and detailed interior and exterior spaces
This model enabled the client to remotely monitor and control lighting and mechanical devices, optimizing energy efficiency and supported material cost reduction

Conducted surveys of the office space to ensure floorplans and models accurately reflected the building
Incorporated client's model into Unreal Engine 5 using Twinmotion to enhance the visualization of the model
I learnt about 3D component design and architecture modeling using industry-standard tools such as Autodesk AutoCAD and Revit. The training enabled me to update and create specific components for a client's 3D office model, providing practical, hands-on experience in the application of these technologies. These projects have honed my abilities to visualize and implement complex designs effectively.

To ensure the accuracy of the floorplans and models, I conducted in-person surveys of the office space. This hands-on approach allowed me to verify that all dimensions and details were precise, contributing to the overall quality and reliability of the 3D models. This attention to detail ensures that the final product met the highest standards of accuracy and functionality.

Additionally, my 3D model has been implemented as a real-time digital twin of the actual office space and showcased at a tech conference at the O2. This allows users to remotely monitor and control the lighting and mechanical devices within the office. By adjusting these systems in real-time, users can optimize energy efficiency and reduce costs. The model not only provides a dynamic view of the office environment but serves as a valuable tool for enhancing operational efficiency and sustainability.

### Volleyball Scoreboard Android App
**(2024)**

**Key Features:**

Score Management:

Users can update the score for both the home and away teams by incrementing or decrementing the score using buttons. The score is displayed in EditText fields.
Logic is in place to detect which team is serving. If the non-serving team scores a point, the serving team alternates, and the court players rotate automatically.
The app checks for match points, adhering to the rule where the first team to reach 25 points with at least a 2-point lead wins. A win notification is provided via a Toast message.
Court Rotation:

The app manages player rotations based on the 6-player volleyball formation. Players' positions are rotated automatically whenever the serving team changes after a point is scored by the non-serving team.
Two sets of player position grids (one for each team) are implemented using GridLayouts in the XML file, where each position (P1â€“P6) is represented by editable circles (EditText views styled with custom backgrounds). These positions can be customized by tapping on them and entering player numbers.
Serving Indicator:

A TextView informs the user which team is currently serving (either "Home is serving" or "Away is serving"), with the serving team alternating whenever needed.
UI Layout:

The layout consists of RelativeLayouts for organizing score-related elements, such as buttons for incrementing and decrementing scores, and a central section for displaying and editing scores.
The court positions (P1-P6) are displayed in two separate GridLayouts, visually representing the positions of players on the court for both sets.
